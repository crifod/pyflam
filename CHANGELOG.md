## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **License: relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later.** pyflam is now
  distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later. This is
  a strong network-copyleft license: anyone who distributes a modified version,
  **or offers it to users over a network** (e.g. hosting the Streamlit GUI in
  `pyflam_gui/` as a service), must make the complete corresponding source of
  their modified version available under the same terms.
  ([#2](https://github.com/crifod/pyflam/pull/2))
  - `LICENSE` now contains the verbatim GNU AGPL v3 text.
  - New `NOTICE` file records the copyright holder, the AGPL warranty notice, and
    the FlamMap independence disclaimer.
  - SPDX headers in all `src/` and `pyflam_gui/` source files updated to
    `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.
  - `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and the scientific-report docs updated to
    reflect the new license.
